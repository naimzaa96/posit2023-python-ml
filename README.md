# Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python @ POSIT::CONF(2023)
Workshop materials for [posit::conf(2023)](https://posit.co/conference/) in Chicago.

**Monday, Sep 18 | 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM CDT**

- Please also check the official [Tutorial Schedule](https://reg.conf.posit.co/flow/posit/positconf23/attendee-portal/page/sessioncatalog) for updates.

## Abstract

In this workshop, you will learn the machine and deep learning fundamentals using a modern open-source stack. We’ll start with a brief introduction to Python’s scientific computing libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which provide the foundation for data analysis and visualization. From there, we will dive into the scikit-learn API, a user-friendly, open-source library for machine learning in Python. You will learn how to use it to create machine learning classifiers and apply tree-based models like random forests, gradient boosting, and XGBoost. 

In the second part of this workshop, we will also cover deep learning concepts and introduce PyTorch, the most widely used deep learning research library. You will also learn about training multi-layer neural networks efficiently using multi-GPU and mixed-precision techniques. Finally, we will explore how to use a pretrained large language transformer with scikit-learn and fine-tune it on a custom downstream task using PyTorch. 

By the end of this workshop, you will have a good understanding of the fundamental principles of machine learning and be able to construct advanced classification pipelines for tabular data using scikit-learn. Additionally, you will gain experience in image classification and natural language processing techniques using PyTorch and be able to implement them in your own predictive modeling projects effectively. 

This workshop is for you if you:

- are a researcher, programmer, or engineer who wants to apply machine learning and deep learning
- are a scientific computing practitioner who is interested in predictive modeling
- are a problem solver who want to learn about Python-tools for tabular, image, and text data



## Material & Preparation

The workshop material will be posted ahead of time but may be updated on the weekend before the event. To prepare for the workshop, there are only 4 small action items prior to the workshop are

1. (Optional) If you are new to Python, you may find the **Python Setup Guide** ([./00-1_python-setup-guide](./00-1_python-setup-guide)) helpful, which mainly describes how I set up Python on my computer(s).
2. Please go through **Python Library Installation** ([./00-2_python-libraries-for-workshop](./00-2_python-libraries-for-workshop)) guide to ensure you have all the required libraries installed prior to the workshop.
3. I recommend downloading this repository before the event so you can access the materials offline in case of a slow internet connection during the workshop.
4. And, of course, please bring your laptop (and charger) to get the most out of this workshop!

Looking forward to seeing you there!
